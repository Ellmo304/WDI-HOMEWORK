Turn based
board
9 tiles
2 players


setup:
boom
link files together
lay out board/css


create clickevents on elements. insert values/textcontent/innerhtml to x or o when clicked
could console log to check working


look after clicks for win condition


win condition:
a player wins IF
         one players counter is in every tile in a row, column or diagonal

draw condition:
 a draw IF
        no player has won but all tiles picked/filled

      if had click listener  once 9 clicks, game is over?
